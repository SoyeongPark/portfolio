The wind blows daddy’s scarf up into the sky.
It’s stuck in a tree, way up high.
‘Now what?’ daddy Bear asks with a bit of a howl.
‘I know who can get your scarf,’ baby Bear calls. ‘Owl!’
‘And why would I do that?’ Owl says, slightly vain.
‘That scarf is very important to us,’ baby Bear explains.
‘I’ll help you, but just this once, you see.’
And he tosses the scarf down from the tree.
‘I like Owl,’ baby Bear says cheerfully after a moment.
‘Well you shouldn’t,’ grumbles daddy Bear.
‘Look at his scarf, the colours are different.’
‘Come on, let’s go!’ daddy Bear says swiftly.
‘Or we’ll miss the match, definitely.’




There’s Zebra, racing by with a steady tread.
Now a question pops up in baby Bear’s head.
‘Daddy, is Zebra black? Or is he white?’
‘Euh...’ daddy Bear says, thinking with all his might.
‘Good question,’ Zebra mutters with a pensive note.
‘I don’t really think about it, this is simply my coat.
You decide. Black or white, it doesn’t matter to me.’
‘Your skin is your skin,’ says baby Bear. ‘That’s what I see.’
‘That wasn’t wise!’ daddy Bear says with a grunt.
‘Look at his scarf. The colours are different.’
‘Let’s go,’ says daddy Bear. ‘We’d better run.
Or we’ll be late and miss all the fun.’




‘Help!’
‘Help!’
What does baby Bear hear?
‘Help!’
Someone’s calling in fear.
Baby Buffalo comes running.
‘Help! My daddy’s blind! He can’t see a thing!’
Buffalo’s eyes are covered with leaves, twigs and thorns.
The wind has blown them right onto his horns.
Daddy Bear laughs at this strange sight.
But daddy Buffalo is downright terrified.
‘Come,’ baby Bear says. ‘I’ll help you out of this jam.
There, Buffalo. Now you can see again!’
‘Don’t help Buffalo!’ daddy Bear growls very insistent.
‘Look at his scarf. The colours are different.’
‘Come on, let’s go. We can’t wait.
All this talk will make us late.’




The bears suddenly hear shouting by the river ahead.
‘The bridge is broken!’
the animals are yelling, clearly upset.
No one can get to their match; things are getting heated.
The animals are arguing, they all look defeated.






‘I’m angriest!’
Peacock calls with a scarf in purple and white.
‘My team is the best, I’m certainly right.’
‘No way!’ calls Rooster, his scarf white and red.
‘My team plays with passion, that much can be said.’
All the animals bicker and shout.
They gesture, argue and cry out.
They’re ready to charge, these growlers.
Look at their scarves, all those different colours.




‘How can we get to the match
when things look so bleak?’
baby Bear sobs.
A tear rolling down his cheek.



But then daddy Bear has an idea.
‘Stop!’ he roars. ‘Listen to me!
All this time I’ve been placing the blame.
But now I see were all the same.’
‘I’m not like Canary!’ proud Peacock calls out resolutely.
‘Look at you!’ daddy Bear says. ‘You’re both equally angry, surely.’
‘I don’t have horns like Buffalo!’ Rabbit yells hastily.
‘But you’re both wearing scarves,’ daddy Bear says. ‘As you can see.’
‘The different colours aren’t a taunt.
It’s all the same thing that we want.
Every animal, every beast, wants to go to their football feast.’
The animals look each other up and down.
‘Bear, what you say is true,’ they frown.





Baby Bear says ‘We need to work together as one.
Take off your scarf and pass it along.
We’ll tie them together and work as a team.’
And that’s how all the animals cross the stream.
Everyone’s feeling light of heart.
Just in time for the match to start.
Believe it or not but everyone
wishes each other lots of fun.




‘So, the other colours aren’t so bad?’
baby Bear asks softly.
‘No,’ daddy Bear says. Baby Bear smiles with glee.
‘Everyone loves their own scarf,that’s how they see it.’
Daddy Bear grins,
‘But blue and black are still my favourite.’


‘We made it! Just in time,
though I feared we wouldn’t be.
Welcome, baby Bear,
to the football party!’
